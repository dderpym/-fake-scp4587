Addendum 7239-G: Behavioral Changes and Mental Health Observations

Date and Time: [REDACTED]

Location: [REDACTED]

SCP-7239 has recently claimed to be suffering from depression, as evidenced by changes in its online presence. SCP-7239 updated its social media profile picture to depict an anime character, identified as [REDACTED] from [REDACTED]. The specific scene chosen shows [REDACTED] crying in the rain, a visual often associated with emotional distress.

Upon careful examination, researchers have linked this change to SCP-7239's reported symptoms of depression. Notably, engagement in an activity known as "Gartic Phone" with a group of at least 2 others appears to alleviate these symptoms temporarily. However, it is crucial to note that the symptoms can quickly resurface if any individual makes negative remarks about SCP-7239.

This newfound information suggests a potential link between SCP-7239's mental well-being and its interactions with others. The avoidance of the containment block designated "Period 6" may be connected to SCP-7239's reported depression, indicating a need for further investigation into the psychological aspects of its anomalous properties.

Researchers are advised to continue monitoring SCP-7239's mental health and its responses to different social interactions for a more comprehensive understanding of its behavioral patterns and potential therapeutic interventions.
