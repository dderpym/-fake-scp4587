**Addendum 4587-C: History Class Incident**

Date and Time: [REDACTED]

Location: [REDACTED]

During a history class on [REDACTED], SCP-4587 made an unusual comparison while discussing the concept of receiving a test. When the teacher announced an upcoming examination, SCP-4587 vocalized, stating, "This feels like getting ambushed by the Viet Cong during the war."

The statement drew immediate attention from both the teacher and fellow students. SCP-4587's analogy was noted for its unexpected and seemingly incongruous nature, as well as its apparent lack of context.

Upon inquiry, SCP-4587 did not provide any further explanation for the analogy and appeared visibly uncomfortable when questioned. The incident concluded with no further noteworthy events.

This incident suggests that SCP-4587 may exhibit a tendency to draw unusual or inappropriate analogies during conversations or discussions, which could indicate an aspect of its anomalous behavior that merits further investigation.
