Addendum 4587-E: Interview - Reference to the "New Era"

Date and Time: [REDACTED]

Location: [REDACTED]

During an interview with SCP-4587 on [REDACTED], SCP-4587 repeatedly made references to a concept it referred to as the "New Era." When asked to clarify the meaning of this term, SCP-4587 provided limited and cryptic explanations, emphasizing the notion of "change" and "advancement." He also referred to "the opps."

SCP-4587's statements included mentions of "ushering in the New Era" and "being a part of something greater." The exact implications of the "New Era" as described by SCP-4587 remain unclear, and further investigation is required to determine its significance in relation to SCP-4587's anomalous properties.

While it is still unknown what "the opps" refers to, they seem to cause great distress to SCP-4587. It may be useful to determine what this is if the current containment procedures prove inadequate.
