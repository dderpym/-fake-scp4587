**Incident 7239-B-1: Lunchtime Interaction**

Date and Time: [REDACTED]

Location: [REDACTED]

During lunchtime on [REDACTED], SCP-7239 exhibited a notable desire to interact with multiple groups of individuals. It initiated conversations with various individuals present and, on multiple occasions, brought up the subject of homecoming. SCP-7239 expressed a sense of pride at having been nominated for homecoming royalty. Notably, SCP-7239 did not secure the homecoming royalty title and was evidently perplexed by both the nomination and the identity of the nominator.

During this incident, SCP-7239 appeared to be cooperative and non-confrontational, despite the absence of a favorable response from the individuals it attempted to engage with. No unusual behaviors or manifestations were reported during this time.
